<p class="subheadline">Welcome to Your Future Professional Network</p>

CoffeeMe introduces you to useful people  you want to meet professionally. 

Here's how it works:

* We suggest someone you should meet, 
* You tell us whether you want to meet them and 
* If you both want to meet, we introduce you via email.

CoffeeMe was founded by <a href="http://twitter.com/hsukenooi" target="_blank">Hsu Ken Ooi</a>. He previously co-founded <a href="http://decide.com" target="_blank">Decide.com</a> a tool that predicted the future price of consumer goods. Decide was acquired by eBay in late 2013.
