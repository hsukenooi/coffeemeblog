<b>What type of people will I meet?</b>
Founders, engineers, designers and business people from other startups. Even a few investors. No recruiters.

<b>Can I change my response to someone?</b>
Yes! After you've gone through everyone in the network, there's a "reset your queue" button that will reset everyone you've said no too. It doesn't change any of the yeses.

<b>What happens when I say yes to someone?</b>
If they say yes to you then you'll be introduced via email. They won't know how you answered unless they say yes too.

<b>What happens when I say no to someone?</b>
Nothing. They'll never know how you answered.

<b>What happens when I match with someone?</b>
The first person to say yes will be introduced via email. The second person will be notified on the site.

<b>Do I have to meet the people I match with?</b>
You don't have to but you did say you wanted to :)

<b>Do I have to meet them right away?</b>
Nope. There's no rules on when you have to meet them. That's up to the both of you. It could be this week or next month.

<b>What cities is CoffeeMe available?</b>
Just good old Seattle.

<b>Why is it invite only?</b>
To ensure every member has worked at a startup before and live in the cities we've launched in.
