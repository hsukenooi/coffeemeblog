To edit your profile, click on your email address in the top right corner of the page. A drop down menu will appear, click "Settings". 

You'll see the following screen:

<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coffeeme/profile-edit.png" target="_blank" style="border: 0;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coffeeme/profile-edit.png" width="540"></a>

Although this is standard stuff, it moved up our priority list because members told us they wanted different information on their CoffeeMe profile than their Linkedin profile. In a few cases they were more motivated to keep their profile up-to-date on CoffeeMe.
