title: "100 Matches and Introducing Match History"

When we started working on CoffeeMe we curbed our expectations. We've built plenty of products that were rarely used even though we thought they were great. CoffeeMe has been different. We had our first match within the first hour and on Friday we surpassed 100 matches. It's encouraging to hear stories about people actually meeting each other and making meaningful connections. We never knew there were so many people doing great stuff in Seattle!

In celebration of our 100th match we're also introducing Match History, a way to see everyone you've matched with and their email addresses.

To get to your Match History, click on your email in the top right and then on the "Your Match History" link. No more writing down their email address when you match, we'll keep track of your new contacts for you.

Here's to 1000 matches!
